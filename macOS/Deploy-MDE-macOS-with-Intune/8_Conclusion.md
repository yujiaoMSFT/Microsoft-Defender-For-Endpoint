## Final thoughts

Thank you for taking the time to read through this guide! I hope it helps you get started with deploying and onboarding Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) on macOS in your environment.
This document focuses primarily on deployment and onboarding. It does not cover advanced configurations or feature specific details, those will be addressed in future posts. 
I plan to continue sharing more in-depth content on these topics, so stay tuned!
